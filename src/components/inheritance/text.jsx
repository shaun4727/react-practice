     * what is composition in react
     * âœ… What is Composition in React?
     * Composition in React means building complex UIs by combining smaller, reusable components â€”
     * like putting Lego blocks together. It's not about avoiding class components specifically,
     * but rather about how you structure and reuse components, whether you're using class or functional
     * components.
     *
     *
     * ðŸ§© The Core Idea:
     * Instead of using inheritance (extending components), React encourages you to compose components using
     * props and children.
